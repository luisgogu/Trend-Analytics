Hanging your bike on the wall isn't a new idea. And there are lots of bike-rack-sorts-of-things you can use. Go on. Google \"wall mount bike rack\".  I'll wait. Anything really grab you? I mean, there are a couple cool floating shelves, and a bunch of stuff made far far away in huge factories. And the floating shelves are neat, but to me that puts too much emphasis on mounting hardware. I wanted something different. Something easy to install, sturdy and with some heft, and a simple design that relied on skillful joinery to give a sense of delicacy that belies the strength and capacity of the piece. I also wanted to really showcase and celebrate the wood. The shelf is made from 5/4 (1 1/4\" thick) material, and we arrange to really showcase interesting features in the grain. The two pieces are joined with a miter that has a spline running the length of it, which is exceedingly strong as, in this case, the joint is joining the pieces long-grain-to-long-grain. It's finished with a durable wiping varnish. With this shelf, the top tube rests in a channel and the tube is supported from the sides (this leaves some room below the tube for cables, if the bike is so equipped). The shelf is sized for 1-1 1/8\" tubes, but can be customized for thicker or non-circular composite frames. The shelf attaches to the wall with a simple French cleat, and designed so that you hang the shelf, then slide it over an inch to the right, and it locks in place. Standard size is 16\" wide by approximately 10\" deep and 12\" tall (depending on the edge). The depth will accomodate most handlebars, but if your bike has very wide handlebars, you may need to turn them a bit, or you can also request a wider shelf. I have some beautiful slabs of cherry that will be enough for a handful of bike shelves as seen here (until I get some more beautiful slabs) - each of those shelves is a unique piece, and all of the wood in each shelf comes from the same flitch (the big slab of wood). A simpler walnut version without the live edge will be available soon. And I have not forgotten those whose bikes do not have top tubes. Stay tuned. It's in the works for later this spring. Get in touch if interested in reserving one of the initial pieces.","followers":"None","date":"2021-03-30 07:29:55","datePublished":"2012-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","authorName":"Poplar","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/thepoplar"},{"id":"COLGADOR","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/649433208778540375/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/9b/65/0a/9b650a9a37abbb1e93447f2ac030ed3b.jpg","title":"Coffee Mug Rack- wall mounted","tags":["Wall Hat Racks","Diy Hat Rack","Wooden Pallet Projects","Pallet Crafts","Coffee Mug Display","Coffee Mugs","Coffee Mug Wall Rack","Mug Rack","Wooden Diy"],"description":" ","description2":"Jun 23, 2020 - What you need to know- Made out of solid wood and then stained with a custom gray/walnut.  measures 18 wide by 18 high.

Perfect for Many Situations. Increasingly, customers are using our shelf brackets for open kitchen shelves. Plus, they continue to be used for books, dry goods in pantries and many more uses. Beautiful and Built to Last. We use only the finest solid maple, solid cherry, solid oak and solid American poplar for our shelf brackets. Plus, they are joined with high quality glue and screws. They are rated at 200 pounds per bracket. They are meticulously sanded and all edges have been neatly rounded over. Our shelf brackets are in stock and ready for you to stain and finish. See our Finishing Tips. An Important Design Consideration. Our shelf brackets will extend above the bottom of your shelf. Your shelf will butt against this extended portion and rest 3/4\" from your wall. If you must place your shelf flush with your wall, you may cut a 3/4\" deep X 2\" wide notch in your shelf or consider using our corbels instead. Easy to Install. Our design allows for easy installation, just screw to wall and plug. We include screws, plugs, and complete instructions. Attaching to drywall only? No problem, see our Drywall Installation Kits. Plan on painting your shelf brackets? Our paint grade shelf brackets are sanded and ready for you to paint. We intend for you to paint them because they may contain discolorations and filled knot holes.  They may be made from maple, poplar or alder.  Maple, poplar and alder are \"tight, closed grain\" woods, ideal for painting.  Construction. The shelf bracket's right angle joint is glued and screwed with two #10 X 1 1/2\" long wood screws. The shelf bracket's vertical member is 3/4\" thick X 2\" wide. The shelf bracket's horizontal member is 3/4\" thick X 1 1/2\" wide. The shelf bracket's brace is assembled with two #10 X 1 1/2\" long wood screws also. Our straight and concave braces are 3/4\" thick X 1 1/2\" wide.","followers":"None","date":"2022-04-19 01:24:08","datePublished":"2022-04-19T01:24:08.000Z","authorName":"Valerie Mir","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/valeriemirota"},{"id":"COLGADOR","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/130745195423027352/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/a8/b8/9d/a8b89d4e84770b129730108a634f3532.jpg","title":"14 Ideas De Percheros Que Podrás Hacer Con Madera Vieja | Manualidades eli","tags":["Diy Rustic Decor","Modern Decor","Diy Home Decor","Rustic Modern","Coat Hook Shelf","Wall Mounted Coat Rack","Coat Rack With Shelf","Wall Coat Rack","Coat Hooks On Wall"],"description":" ","description2":"03-nov-2021 - ¿Sabías que puedes hacer bonitos y útiles percheros...","followers":"234k followers","date":"2022-03-21 05:18:51","datePublished":"2021-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","authorName":"Pam Murphy","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/dollinglady"},{"id":"COLGADOR","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/261068109638898184/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/d3/ab/5f/d3ab5fafa33bfe83f065fa79b9895fe6.jpg","title":"Hall de entrada","tags":["Home Design Decor","Interior Design Living Room","House Design","Room Decor Bedroom","Living Room Decor","Escalier Design","Decoration Entree","Diy Crafts For Home Decor","Decorations For Home","Room Ideas Bedroom","Home Bedroom","Bedroom Decor","Bedroom Inspo","Home Office Inspiration","Office Ideas","Interior Inspiration","Cozy Room","Aesthetic Room Decor","House Plants Decor","Plant Decor","Bathroom Interior Design","Interior Decorating","Decorating Kitchen","House Design","Pavilion Architecture","Chinese Architecture","First Apartment Decorating","Interior Design","Simple Apartment Decor","Small Apartment Living","Small Living Rooms","Cozy Living","Living Room Decor Ideas Apartment","Rustic Living Room Decor","Home Room Design","Home Interior Design","Living Room Designs","Home Living Room","Living Room Decor","House Rooms","Kitchen Room Design","Modern Kitchen Design","Home Decor Kitchen","Interior Design Kitchen","Kitchen Furniture","Home Kitchens","Kitchen Organisation","Diy Kitchen Storage","Kitchen Remodel"],"description":" ","description2":"2 Dec 2020 - This Pin was created by Apartamento 203 on Pinterest.
