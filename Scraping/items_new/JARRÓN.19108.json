Bernard's inspirations are many, from the classic forms of antiquity to the simple, graceful pots made by indigenous peoples and the work of modern studio potters. His current body of work deals with simple, clean form. Handles and other flourishes are conspicuously lacking. Dramatic color and subtle texture accentuate what he hopes is a mastery of the traditional vessel form. Bernard throws each piece on the potter's wheel using earthenware clay. The surface is finished with layers of textured, colored slips and oxides. The work is fired multiple times in a gas or electric kiln to cone 03 (approximately 2000¬∞F). Early experiences with clay as a child left a mark on Bernard. After earning a BFA from Arizona State University and learning even more through apprenticeships, making pots became a way of life. Bernard has been a studio potter for more than 30 years, living and working in Arizona for much of that time. Even after 30 years, every day in the studio is an adventure.","followers":"218k followers","date":"2022-03-19 02:15:52","datePublished":"2022-03-19T02:15:52.000Z","authorName":"Kim Chayeb","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/kimchayeb"},{"id":"JARR√ìN","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/24488391714802004/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/91/62/54/9162547449a686b5cd6085c7b49f3182.jpg","title":"How To Make Pots/ Containers  Look Old -Part 2","tags":["Diy Painted Vases","Spray Paint Vases","Painted Pots","Ceramic Pots","Ceramic Flowers","Vintage Vases","Vintage Pottery","Pottery Barn","Ceramic Painting","Wabi Sabi","Pottery Handbuilding","Clay Pots","Ceramic Pottery","Interior Inspiration","Interior And Exterior","Decoration","House Design","House Styles","Pottery Pots","Olive Jar","Garden Urns","Still Life Art","Pottery Painting","Ceramic Clay","Terracotta Pots","Home Depot","Terracotta","Farmhouse Addition","Oriental Furniture","Metal Vase","Ceramic Jars","Decorated Jars","Metal Crafts","Simple Elegance","Still Life Drawing","Still Life Photos","Still Life Photography","Nature Photography","Fashion Photography","Painting Inspiration","Abstract Art","Diys","Vase","Projects","Crafts","Inspiration","Home Decor","Rustic Vases","Log Projects","Biblical Inspiration","Vase Crafts","Cork Crafts","Diy And Crafts","Diy Furniture Projects","Diy Projects","Beton Design","Cement Planters","Creation Deco","Concrete Projects","Ceramic Pitcher","Pottery Patterns","Pottery Designs","Earthenware","Stoneware","Mini Canvas Art","Stone Spray Paint","Spray Paint Vases","Textured Spray Paint","Concrete Spray Paint","Spray Paint Ceramic","Diy Painted Vases","Painted Pots","Old Vases","Black Vase","Diy Spray Paint","Faux Brick Walls","Bleached Wood","Country Furniture","Baskets On Wall","A Table","Creations","Flower Vase Design","Flower Vases","Clay Vase","Ceramic Vase","Porcelain Ceramic","Pottery Vase","Ceramic Pottery","Pottery Teapots","Slab Pottery","Ceramic Art","Glazed Pottery","Pottery Art","Tuscan Style","Belle Photo","Feng Shui","Garden Art","Garden Ideas"],"description":"How To Make Pots/ Containers Look Old -Part 2","description2":"Jun 12, 2021 - Another pot project‚Ä¶I found this huge one at a thrift store for $8!

Russia enjoys indeed important quarries which are known since the 17th century, including that of Nijni Taguil, discovered in 1835 and exploited by Count Demidoff.Used in blocks to make small objects, malachite is not appropriate to the realize large works such as those that can be made in marble. This is why  -- Russian mosaic --  was developed in the second half of the 18th century: slivers of malachite are clad to give the illusion of a block, enabling to display this extraordinary color on walls, columns, doors, and other elements of interior decoration. The royal lapidary manufactures of Peterhof and Ekaterinburg developed this art, which soon seduced the aristocracy.Thus in 1775, the Viceroy of New Spain (Mexico) had the first the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa  -- Malachite Room --  for his Castle of Chapultepec. The malachite of Siberia decorates notably an impressive Rococo door.The new beauty of this refined art creates a craze that will last during all nineteenth century. France discovered this famous technique when, in 1808, Alexander I of Russia gave Napoleon I some gifts in malachite. Candelabra, large vases and a basin are installed in the Salon of the Emperor in Trianon, now known as the  -- Malachite Room -- .The French craftsmen are then working on malachite, and during the Restoration, Pierre-Philippe Thomire produced several pieces, including the large Medici Vase mounted in gilt bronze, commissioned by Prince Demidoff, and now preserved at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.In Russia, the discovery of the Nijni Taguil quarry in 1835 allows to think bigger for the monuments of Saint-Petersburg. Thus, malachite covers the immense columns of St. Isaac Cathedral, and a new  -- Malachite Hall --  is designed for the magnificent Winter Palace.Indeed, the architect Alexander Briullov designed in 1839 a reception room for the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna, wife of Nicholas I, with columns and a fireplace in malachite.A true Russian treasure, numerous ornaments from paper-press to monumental vases adopt malachite, including a large collection preserved in the Hermitage Museum.Circa 1860, this is probably what motivated Mme de Pa√Øva, of Russian origin, to insert a malachite veneer on the fireplace of her room in her famous Parisian mansion.","followers":"2k followers","date":"2020-01-07 15:46:11","datePublished":"2020-01-07T15:46:11.000Z","authorName":"Meagan Andrews","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/mrsmeagan"},{"id":"JARR√ìN","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/351912461899323/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/04/80/70/0480700fe4732c1439afd85f35582bb0.jpg","title":"Fenton, Hobnail Plum (Opalescent)","tags":["Fenton Glassware","Antique Glassware","Antique Bottles","Vintage Bottles","Vintage Perfume","Cut Glass","Glass Art","Cranberry Glass","Murano","Vintage Vases","Vintage Glassware","Cristal Art","Painted Glass Vases","Fenton Glassware","Paper Vase","Glas Art","Blown Glass Art","Motif Floral","Glass Jug","Glass Pitchers","Cut Glass","Milk Glass","Antique Glassware","Blue Carnival Glass","Glass Photo","Glass Collection","Vintage Perfume","Tiffany Blue","Antique Glass","Antique Bottles","Vintage Bottles","Carnival Glass","Fenton Lamps","Fenton Milk Glass","Glass Ceramic","Olive Oil Dispenser","Olive Oil Bottles","Cranberry Glass","Vintage Dishware","Vintage Dishes","Glass Shoes","Purple Glass","Vintage Dinnerware","Dinnerware Sets","Glass Art","Indiana Glass","Mosaic Glass","Viking Glass","Vintage Interiors","Glass Kitchen","Crystal Glassware","Milk Glass Cake Stand","Fish Sculpture","Glass Figurines","Glass Animals","Antique Dishes","Porcelain Dolls For Sale","Purple Kitchen","Cheese Dome","Purple Home","All Things Purple","Fenton Glass","Antique Lamps","Vintage Kitchen","Vintage Items","Purple Reign","Style Vintage"],"description":"Hobnail Plum (Opalescent) 70 Oz Ice Lip Jug by Fenton | Replacements, Ltd.","description2":"Apr 28, 2020 - Shop Hobnail Plum (Opalescent) Crystal & Glasses by Fenton at Replacements, Ltd.

Russia enjoys indeed important quarries which are known since the 17th century, including that of Nijni Taguil, discovered in 1835 and exploited by Count Demidoff.Used in blocks to make small objects, malachite is not appropriate to the realize large works such as those that can be made in marble. This is why  -- Russian mosaic --  was developed in the second half of the 18th century: slivers of malachite are clad to give the illusion of a block, enabling to display this extraordinary color on walls, columns, doors, and other elements of interior decoration. The royal lapidary manufactures of Peterhof and Ekaterinburg developed this art, which soon seduced the aristocracy.Thus in 1775, the Viceroy of New Spain (Mexico) had the first the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa  -- Malachite Room --  for his Castle of Chapultepec. The malachite of Siberia decorates notably an impressive Rococo door.The new beauty of this refined art creates a craze that will last during all nineteenth century. France discovered this famous technique when, in 1808, Alexander I of Russia gave Napoleon I some gifts in malachite. Candelabra, large vases and a basin are installed in the Salon of the Emperor in Trianon, now known as the  -- Malachite Room -- .The French craftsmen are then working on malachite, and during the Restoration, Pierre-Philippe Thomire produced several pieces, including the large Medici Vase mounted in gilt bronze, commissioned by Prince Demidoff, and now preserved at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.In Russia, the discovery of the Nijni Taguil quarry in 1835 allows to think bigger for the monuments of Saint-Petersburg. Thus, malachite covers the immense columns of St. Isaac Cathedral, and a new  -- Malachite Hall --  is designed for the magnificent Winter Palace.Indeed, the architect Alexander Briullov designed in 1839 a reception room for the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna, wife of Nicholas I, with columns and a fireplace in malachite.A true Russian treasure, numerous ornaments from paper-press to monumental vases adopt malachite, including a large collection preserved in the Hermitage Museum.Circa 1860, this is probably what motivated Mme de Pa√Øva, of Russian origin, to insert a malachite veneer on the fireplace of her room in her famous Parisian mansion.","followers":"2k followers","date":"2020-01-07 15:46:11","datePublished":"2020-01-07T15:46:11.000Z","authorName":"Meagan Andrews","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/mrsmeagan"},{"id":"JARR√ìN","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/147141112807639650/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/1e/6a/49/1e6a49f51549b1591c8336ada8fa33e2--japanese-porcelain-work-of-art.jpg","title":"Antiques | 1stdibs","tags":["Japanese Vase","Japanese Porcelain","Japanese Ceramics","Decoration","Art Decor","Octopus","Vases Decor","Decorative Objects","Asian Art","Japanese Vase","Japanese Porcelain","Japanese Ceramics","Vases For Sale","Hanging Paintings","Art Japonais","China Painting","Pottery Painting","Glass Collection","Japanese Flowers","Japanese Pottery","Art Decor","Decoration","Metal Vase","Porcelain Vase","Chinese Art","Vases Decor","Insect Art","Kintsugi","Art Object","Asian Art","Decoration Piece","Crackpot Caf√©","Japanese Museum","Painted Vases","Painted Pottery","Fancy Dishes","Paint Your Own Pottery","Japanese Aesthetic","Ceramic Decor","Ceramic Pottery","Pottery Art","Ceramic Art","Japan Crafts","Art Nouveau","Japanese China","All Japanese","Japanese History","Turning Japanese","Ceramic Vase","Finding Treasure","Small Sculptures","Crystal Glassware","Japanese Drawings","Japanese Artwork","Koi Art","Keramik Vase","Carp","Calla Lilies","Porcelain Jewelry","Porcelain Ceramics","Porcelain Tiles","Painted Porcelain","Fine Porcelain","Pottery Painting Designs","Meiji Era","Art Uk","Metal Working","Glass Art","Sculptures","Chinese Crafts","Jar Art"],"description":"A FINE JAPANESE CLOISONNE SILVER WIRE BIRD VASE (JAPAN)","description2":"Oct 6, 2015 - 1stdibs is your home for the most beautiful antiques on earth: antique furniture, fine jewelry, fashion and art from the world's best dealers.

A nosotras nos ha encantado esta original propuesta de la artista Jatta Lavi. La artista finlandesa Jatta Lavi es la creadora de esta serie de briks de porcelana. Unas piezas elaboradas a mano, con un dise√±o atemporal, minimalista, de formas simples y sin adornos superfluos. Es sorprendente c√≥mo esta ceramista ha conseguido plasmar en su obra la apariencia del cart√≥n, gracias a sus l√≠neas rectas y la ausencia de brillos, ¬øno te parece? Jatta Lavi ha dise√±ado tres propuestas diferentes de este modelo de envase, cada una de un tama√±o. Podr√°s conseguir estos modelos tanto en blanco como en negro. Sin embargo, los briks no son las √∫nicas piezas que ha elaborado esta artista.
