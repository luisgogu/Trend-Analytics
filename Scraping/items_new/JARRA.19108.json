I make  many similar pieces, however, and often a similar pot can be substituted.   If you are not happy with the piece you receive, it can be exchanged or  returned within 30 days.","followers":"None","date":"2020-04-26 00:44:31","datePublished":"2020-04-26T00:44:31.000Z","authorName":"Grace","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/cthulhucakes"},{"id":"JARRA","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/12244230226470983/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/8d/01/00/8d0100aa23ee0edd7b1073ce0e86e161.jpg","title":"Contemporary Ceramics","tags":["Ceramic Pitcher","Ceramic Teapots","Ceramic Pottery","Pottery Art","Ceramic Art","Hand Built Pottery","Contemporary Ceramics","Modern Ceramics","Rustic Ceramics","Ceramic Shop","Ceramic Design","Ceramic Clay","Ceramic Bowls","Handmade Ceramic","Handmade Pottery","Stoneware","Hand Built Pottery","Hand Thrown Pottery","Ceramic Pitcher","Ceramic Pottery","Pottery Art","Keramik Vase","Cafetiere","Pottery Designs","Ceramic Artists","Slab Pottery","Ceramic Jugs","Earthenware","Pottery Bowls","Ceramic Planters","Pottery Handbuilding","Ceramics Projects","Ceramic Birds","Ceramic Vase","Ceramic Techniques","Pottery Techniques","Pottery Painting","Ceramic Painting","Slab Ceramics","Ceramic Tableware","Ceramic Teapots","Thrown Pottery","Pottery Mugs","Pottery Sculpture","Ceramics Pottery Mugs","Ceramic Plates","Clay Mugs","Wheel Thrown Pottery","Ceramic Art","Pottery Teapots","Glass Ceramic","Ceramic Cups","Porcelain Ceramics","Porcelain Dinnerware","Fine Porcelain","Large Coffee Mugs","Unique Coffee Mugs","Pottery Vase","Japanese Ceramics","Japanese Pottery","Sculptures Céramiques","Teapots And Cups","Tea Art","Wabi Sabi"],"description":" ","description2":"May 27, 2017 - Handmade in Japan  Details Origin   A unique handmade collection by Japanese artist Nobue Ibaraki. The deep ocean glaze reacts gently with the minerals in the clay, sourced locally to Nobue in Tajimi, Japan, evoking a sense of buried treasure.   Dimensions: w-17 cm x h-11cm                         As all products are handmade sizes and colour may vary slightly.   Nobue Ibaraki is based in Tajimi Japan; she has created a unique handmade collection of ceramic objects, including jugs, pourers and bottles, with an earthy palette and glaze that evoke the idea of buried treasure. We are delighted to introduce Nobue Ibaraki to the UK.  ","followers":"2k followers","date":"2021-10-28 05:40:49","datePublished":"2021-10-28T05:40:49.000Z","authorName":"Laura Akita","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/hblauraa"},{"id":"JARRA","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/366269382199142135/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/06/0d/94/060d941a7109980407d05c29abe82db2--ems.jpg","title":"DIY| Faça você mesma seu Cobre Jarra","tags":["Clay Crafts","Youtube","Jewelry","Videos","Towels","Cups","Decorating Tips","Dish Towels","Napkin Holders","Hairpin Lace Crochet","Crochet Lace Edging","Crochet Motifs","Crochet Borders","Crochet Flower Patterns","Bead Crochet","Baby Knitting Patterns","Crochet Designs","Crochet Flowers","Shalwar Kameez","Table Runners","Dyi","Pearl Necklace","Pearls","Chain","Jewelry","Fashion","Cups","Diy Arts And Crafts","Diy Home Crafts","Diy Home Decor","Burlap Table Runners","Lace Table","Deco Table Noel","Burlap Crafts","Decoration Table","Table Covers","Beaded Embroidery","Hand Embroidery","Embroidery Designs","Saree Tassels Designs","Decorative Hand Towels","Fabric Beads","Beading Projects","Bead Crafts","Bead Art","Bead Jewellery","Bead Earrings","Beaded Jewelry","Beaded Trim","Beading Patterns","Hand Towels","Diy And Crafts","Pearl Necklace","Pearls","Jewelry","Step By Step","Recycling","Kitchen","String Of Pearls","Jewlery","Beaded Necklace","Saree Kuchu Designs","Doilies","Origami","Tassels","Nova","Beads","Finger Henna Designs","Henna Tattoo Designs","Beaded Lace","Bordados E Cia","Hanging Beads","Small Sewing Projects","Beaded Jewelry Patterns","Beading Tutorials","Jewelry Crafts","Cute Sewing Projects","Pearl Embroidery","Beaded Christmas Ornaments","Beaded Curtains","Pinterest Diy Crafts","Fancy Earrings","Ribbon Crafts","Crochet Accessories","Diy Craft Projects","Beading","Alice","Diy","Couture","Painting","Crochet Sunflower","Drinkware","Hobbies And Crafts","Diy And Crafts","Arts And Crafts","Diy Jewelry","Beaded Jewelry","Jewelry Making","Diwali Decorations","Beading Patterns","Doilies","Chandelier","Ceiling Lights","Youtube","Ribbon Crafts","Milk","Candy","Candelabra","Chandeliers","Outdoor Ceiling Lights","Christmas Bulbs","Holiday Decor","Home Decor","Dish Towel Crafts","Seed Beads","Craft Ideas","Cups","Napkins"],"description":"Mulher.com 01/06/2015 Ana Maria Ronchel - Cobre copo em pedraria - YouTube","description2":"8/mai/2017 - Oi oi gurias e guris!

L'inspiration de ces modèles vient de Dennis Kyte, un ancêtre peut-on dire du fameux photographe Michel Tcherevkoff qui a sculpté puis photographié ces incroyables bouquets d’escarpins dans son loft new-yorkais. Un travail fou, entièrement « cousu main », à l’aide de clous, de fil en nylon, de colle, d’agrafes… L’ensemble, à la fois mode et poétique, nous donne envie de nous évader (à pied bien sûr !)…. Matériel nécessaire : Crayon à porcelaine pour le dessin, pinceaux Isabey 6227Z nos 3 et 4, pinceau \"épi de blé\" pour effacer, vernis à réserver, plume, éponge.... Couleurs utilisées : Beaucoup de nuances pour donner du relief aux végétaux. Le travail de lissage pour donner de la lumière est également très important.","followers":"317k followers","date":"2018-08-21 17:52:32","datePublished":"2018-08-21T17:52:32.000Z","authorName":"Sigal Yaniv Barak","authorProfile":"https://www.pinterest.es/sigaly65"},{"id":"JARRA","link":"https://www.pinterest.es/pin/351912462115616/","image":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/4f/7d/6d/4f7d6d3a7492853d62939eb998145835.jpg","title":"","tags":["Tin Can Crafts","Fun Diy Crafts","Xmas Crafts","Spring Crafts","Creative Crafts","Painted Trash Cans","Fondant Dog","Decoupage Tins","Teacup Crafts","Decoupage Tins","Decoupage Vintage","Tin Can Crafts","Diy Arts And Crafts","Glass Bottle Crafts","Bottle Art","Vintage Jewelry Crafts","Iron Orchid Designs","Altered Bottles","Cactus","Moscow Mule Mugs","Garden Pots","Living Room Decor","Tea Pots","Old Things","Tray","Gisele","Tableware","Wine Bottle Art","Diy Bottle","Antique Bottles","Vintage Bottles","Vintage Crafts","Jar Art","Jar Crafts","Decoupage Paper","Retro Home","Creative Crafts","Nursery Art","Cottage Garden Design","Garden Art","Garden Plants","House Plants","Succulents In Containers","Planting Succulents","Chicken Wire Crafts","Echeveria","Ard Buffet","Easy Fall Crafts","Diy And Crafts","Shabby Chic Crafts","Shabby Chic Decor","Orchard Design","Unique Garden Decor","Tissue Box Crafts","Cast Iron Pot","Chrysanthemum Flower","Kettles","Tole Painting","Tea Ceremony","Acrylic Pouring","Vintage Tea","Biscuit","Garden Crafts","Garden Projects","Garden Ideas","Teapot Birdhouse","Birdhouse Ideas","Birdhouses","Teacup Crafts","Diy Bird Feeder","Bird Houses Diy","Decoupage Art","Bottle Crafts","Sewing Machine Drawing","Bottle Centerpieces","Antique Glass Bottles","Old Sewing Machines","Living Room Decor Cozy","Diy Crafts For Girls","Diy Crafts For Home Decor","Fun Diy Crafts","Upcycled Crafts","Rock Crafts","Clay Crafts","Decoupage Shoes","Shoe Crafts","Diy Home Crafts","Arts And Crafts","Shabby Chic Pink","Garden Planters","Planter Pots","Recycled Tin Cans","Tin Art","Flower Pots","Flowers","Aqua"],"description":" ","description2":"15-feb-2022 - Link Brighton descrubrió este Pin.
