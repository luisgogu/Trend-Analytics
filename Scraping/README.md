# Trend-Analytics - Scraping

This is the scraping section that extracts the posts from Pinterest. The main code is the "scraping.js" file that uses a series of keywords in the text file "links.txt" to do the searches.

In addition, a notebook is also available which, given a number of posts, counts the frequency of the language of these posts.
